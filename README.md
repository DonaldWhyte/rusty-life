# rusty-life

Rust implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Casually written to pass the time during a weekend of coronavirus self-isolation.

This implementation simulates the Game of Life and renders it on the terminal. The size of the sinulated grid is automatically set to the character width/height of your terminal.

To run the game, simply type:

```
cargo run
```
